# My Portfolio Website - Milestone Project One

This is a website that I created for myself as an online portfolio. My website will be used to present and express my growing capabilities as a developer to potentially catch the eyes of future employers. 

## UX

My website is for current and potential fans and event planners, who are looking to follow the band, listen to their music, book tickets and book the band to perform at their events. My website provides a *"one-stop-shop"* for users, to help them to achieve all of these things, along with several links to the band's external social media and Wikipedia pages.

I've chosen to style my website in the way that I have, as I felt that it best suites the futuristic technological aspect of this occupation.

#### All Pages

- **Hamburger button** - Clicking the hamburger button triggers a full screen overlay menu containing the navigation links to all pages on my website. The user can click the links to navigate to the relevant webpage.
- **Social media links** - Each link opens a new page with the relevant social media page (Facebook, Twitter and Instagram). These links make it easy for users to access the band's social media profiles from one place. The social media profiles load in a new tab, which allows users to then return to the site.
- **Navigation links** - Allows users to navigate around my website by clicking each navigation link, which redirects them to the relevant webpage.

- **Footer social links** - These have the same function as the social media links in the Home Section.

### Features Left to Implement

Once I've learnt JavaScript and back-end web development, I will add further functionality to the existing features on my website.

## Technologies Used

- [**HTML5**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)
    - The project uses **HTML5** to create the basic elements and content of my website.
- [**CSS3**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3)
    - The project uses **CSS3** to add custom styles to the elements and content of my website.
- [**Bootstrap v4.3**](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap v4.3** to add a responsive grid system, prebuilt components, plugins built on jQuery, and Bootstrap styles to my website, before adding my custom styles.
- [**jQuery**](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **jQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation. This is the standard jQuery that is built with Bootstrap components.
- [**JavaScript**](https://www.javascript.com/)
    - The project uses **JavaScript** from Bootstrap which is required to add functionality to some of Bootstrap's components.
- [**Google Fonts**](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - The project uses **Google Fonts** to style the text and suit the style of the band.
- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/)
    - I've used **GitHub** as a remote repository to push and store the committed changes to my project from Git. I've also used GitHub pages to deploy my website in a live environment.

## Testing

### Responsive Testing

I used Microsoft Edge monitor each change made to my website, to ensure it appeared in the desired way on different screen sizes. I also tested my website on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet and desktop) to ensure it appeared in the desired way on different devices.

### HTML and CSS Validation

I used the [W3C HTML Validator tool](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to validate my HTML code.

I used the [W3C CSS Validator tool](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) to validate my CSS code.

## Deployment

The hosting platform that I've used for my project is GitHub Pages. To deploy my website to GitHub pages, I used the following steps:

1. Loaded the terminal window in my Cloud9 workspace.
2. Initialised Git using the `git init` command.
3. Added all files to the Staging area (Git) using the `git add .` command.
4. Committed the files to Git using the `git commit -m "Initial commit"` command.
5. Created a new repository in GitHub called 'monkees-milestone-project-one'.
6. Copied the below code from GitHub into the terminal window in my Cloud9 workspace:

    ```git remote add origin https://github.com/Christ-Mass/MyPortfolioWebsite.git```
    ```git push -u origin master```
7. Entered my GitHub username and password to push the files from Git to GitHub.
8. Went into 'Settings' on my repository page in GitHub.
9. Selected the 'master branch' option under the 'GitHub Pages' section.
10. Ran several regular commits throughout my project.
### Repository Link

### Running Code Locally
To run my code locally, users can download a local copy of my code to their desktop by completing the following steps:
1. Go to [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/Christ-Mass/MyPortfolioWebsite/).
2. Click on 'Clone or download'.
3. Click on 'Download ZIP'.
4. Once dowloaded, extract the zip file's contents and run my website locally.
